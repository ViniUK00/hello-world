# hello-world
This is my first time using GitHub
I am passionate about programming. My goal is to get a job in the Software Development field after graduating. 
I enjoy coding, my strong problem-solving skills allow me to do this well. I am a quick learner with a fun, outgoing personality.
These skills that I have will be a benefit for any Software Development company.
